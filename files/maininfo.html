    <h2>Welcome to the first ever QTCC Creator Clash!</h2>
    <br>
<p>This is a special community event designed for the annual Warframe <u><a href="https://questtoconquercancer.donordrive.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.team&teamID=5095" target="_blank">Quest to Conquer Cancer (QTCC)</a> </u> <br>charity fundraiser benefiting the Princess Margaret Cancer Foundation where the points don’t matter and is totally just for fun!
</p>
<p>Since this is an “on your honor” system you’ll be keeping track of your own points, and we ask that you complete the challenge as intended with no cheating. <br> Otherwise you’ll be haunted with Corrupted Vor’s monologue on repeat until QTCC next year. 
</p>
</p><h3><u> RULES & OBJECTIVES </u></h3>
</p>
<p> Rule #1: Have fun! <br>
    Rule #2: See Rule #1
</p>
<p>  <b>The objective is to defeat every boss* and end with the Zealoid Prelate. </b>
</p>
<p>  Start on Mantle, Earth. Warframe Choices are Excalibur, Mag, & Volt. You are allowed 1 Primary, 1 Secondary, and 1 Melee weapon to start, and may choose from the Lato, Skana, and Mk-1 weapons. <br> Work your way through nodes to get to bosses and through junctions without skipping nodes along the way. Basically play connect the dots.
<br>The routes you take and nodes you clear are up to you!
</p>
<p>  You'll start with no mods for anything (including Parazon), no Operator/Drifter at any time, and no gear wheel. If available, use the Vazarin focus school. You are able to use a companion, <br>but it can only have Fetch/Vacuum and (Primed) Animal Instinct to start. No assault mode, so no weapons. 
</p>
<p>   This challenge may be done solo, with another QTCC streamer, or with your community! However, to keep within the spirit of the event they must follow the same rules and roll their own randomizer as well. 
</p>
<p>   Use the planet check boxes below to check off a node as you complete them. As you check boxes you’ll notice the Points box in the upper left corner of the page will increase. You can then click on a button to roll and acquire a Warframe, weapon, or mod. If you accidentally click a category too many times or roll a duplicate, you can use the Previous Rolls button to undo the last roll, and carry on like nothing happened. Choices are not removed from the pool when you roll them.
</p>
<p>  If you complete a Spy mission with no vault alarms going off, or a rescue mission without the guards being alerted, you get two points instead of one. Tick both boxes for the extra point!
</p>
<p>  This page doesn’t use cookies and therefore will not save the checkboxes when closing the page. We have a spreadsheet available if you’d like to keep track of your progress over the course of several days. You can find that here.
